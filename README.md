### **ðŸ“Œ 100 Days of Code - Learning & Practicing HTML, CSS, Tailwind & SASS**  

#### **ðŸš€ About This Challenge**  
This repository documents my **100 Days of Code** challenge, where I dedicate each day to learning and practicing **HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and SASS**. The goal is to improve my frontend development skills by coding daily, solving real-world problems, and sharing progress on **GitHub**.  

#### **ðŸ“† Challenge Rules**  
- âœ… Code every day for 100 days.  
- âœ… Push daily progress to this GitHub repository.  
- âœ… Document what I learned each day.  
- âœ… Build projects and small challenges along the way.  
- âœ… Stay consistent and never skip a day!

### **ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure**  
Each day's work is stored in a separate folder:

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
